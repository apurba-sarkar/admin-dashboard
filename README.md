# Title: Dashboard Application with Real-time Database Integration (App name: Dashboard Charts)

Introduction:
Our project aims to develop a dynamic dashboard application with real-time data visualization capabilities, leveraging modern technologies such as React Toolkit and Supabase. This dashboard provides users with a comprehensive view of their data through interactive charts, powered by live data fetched from the Supabase database. We prioritize user convenience by offering seamless integration, allowing users to monitor their data in real-time from any device with an internet connection. By utilizing a combination of Ag charts, we've crafted a robust solution that meets the demands of modern data visualization applications.

## Key Features:

Real-time Data Visualization: The dashboard offers interactive charts that dynamically update with real-time data fetched from the Supabase database. Users can monitor changes as they occur, enabling timely decision-making.

Data Fetching from Supabase: All data displayed on the dashboard is fetched from the Supabase database in real-time, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Chart Options: Users can choose from various chart options such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc., to visualize their data according to their preferences and requirements.
